# Admin Dashboard Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 📍 **Admin Dashboard Location: `/` (Root URL)**

The admin dashboard is now located at the root URL, similar to the artist portal:
- **Admins** visiting `/` see the admin dashboard
- **Artists** visiting `/` see the artist portal
- Role is checked server-side to determine which dashboard to display

### 🗂️ **Admin Management Pages**

Specialized management pages for detailed operations:
- `/admin/artworks` - Full artworks management with filtering and actions
- `/admin/artists` - Full artists management with search and actions
- `/admin/events` - Full events management with search and actions
- `/admin` - Redirects to `/` (admin dashboard)

## 🔒 **Four-Layer Security Protection**

Every admin feature is protected by **multiple layers of verification**:

### Layer 1: Middleware ✅
- **File:** `src/middleware.ts`
- **Protects:** All `/admin/*` routes
- **Action:** Blocks non-admin users before page loads
- **Verification:** `user.clientMetadata?.role === "admin"`

### Layer 2: Root Dashboard ✅
- **File:** `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Protects:** Admin dashboard at `/`
- **Action:** Shows admin dashboard only to admin users
- **Verification:** `await isUserAdmin()`

### Layer 3: Admin Layout ✅
- **File:** `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`
- **Protects:** All admin management pages
- **Action:** Redirects non-admins before rendering
- **Verification:** `user.clientMetadata?.role === "admin"`

### Layer 4: Server Actions ✅
- **File:** `src/lib/actions/admin-actions.ts`
- **Protects:** Every admin operation
- **Action:** Throws error if non-admin attempts action
- **Verification:** `await requireAdmin()` in **every action**

## 🛡️ **All 11 Admin Actions Protected**

Each server action includes `await requireAdmin()` as the first line:

### Statistics
1. ✅ `getAdminStats()` - Dashboard statistics

### Data Fetching
2. ✅ `getAllArtworks()` - All artworks
3. ✅ `getAllArtists()` - All artists
4. ✅ `getAllEvents()` - All events

### Artworks Management
5. ✅ `updateArtworkLocation()` - Change artwork location
6. ✅ `toggleArtworkVisibility()` - Show/hide artwork
7. ✅ `deleteArtworkAdmin()` - Delete artwork

### Artists Management
8. ✅ `toggleArtistVisibility()` - Show/hide artist
9. ✅ `deleteArtistAdmin()` - Delete artist

### Events Management
10. ✅ `toggleEventCancellation()` - Cancel/uncancel event
11. ✅ `deleteEventAdmin()` - Delete event

## 🚀 **Server-First Architecture**

### Maximum Server-Side Rendering
- All pages are server components
- Data fetched on server
- Filtering/search happens on server
- Stats calculated on server

### Minimal Client Components
- Only for UI interactivity
- URL param updates (triggers server re-render)
- Button clicks (call server actions)
- Form interactions

### Server Actions Only
- All mutations use server actions
- No client-side data manipulation
- `useTransition` for pending states
- `router.refresh()` after mutations

## 🔐 **Security Verification Checklist**

- ✅ Middleware blocks `/admin/*` for non-admins
- ✅ Root page checks role before showing admin dashboard
- ✅ Admin layout verifies role before rendering
- ✅ All 11 server actions call `requireAdmin()`
- ✅ No admin operations possible without `role: "admin"`
- ✅ All checks happen server-side
- ✅ Cannot bypass via client code
- ✅ Error handling for unauthorized attempts

## 📝 **Admin Role Assignment**

To grant admin access, set in Stack Auth:
```json
{
  "clientMetadata": {
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

**Methods:**
1. Stack Auth Dashboard (Users → Edit User → clientMetadata)
2. Stack Auth API
3. During user creation

**To revoke:** Remove or change the role value.

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### Admin Flow
```
1. Login with admin role
2. See admin dashboard at /
3. View stats, quick actions, and artworks preview
4. Click "Manage Artworks" → /admin/artworks
5. Filter, search, and manage artworks
6. All actions verified and secured
```

### Artist Flow
```
1. Login as artist
2. See artist dashboard at /
3. Manage own artworks and profile
4. Cannot access /admin/* routes
5. Middleware redirects to /
```

## 🔄 **How It Works**

```
User visits / or /admin/*
        ↓
    Middleware checks authentication & role
        ↓
    If admin role === "admin" → Allow
    If not → Redirect to / or /login
        ↓
    Page/Layout verifies role again
        ↓
    Render appropriate dashboard
        ↓
    User clicks action button
        ↓
    Server action called
        ↓
    requireAdmin() verifies role
        ↓
    If admin → Execute & return result
    If not → Throw error
        ↓
    UI updates via router.refresh()
```

## 🎉 **Result**

A fully functional, secure admin dashboard that:
- Lives at `/` for admins (same as artist portal)
- Has dedicated management pages at `/admin/*`
- Verifies admin role at **every level**
- Uses server-first architecture for performance
- Cannot be bypassed or exploited
- Provides comprehensive gallery management

**Only users with `role: "admin"` in Stack Auth can access admin features.**
